- Use Angular 17 with standalone components and Bootstrap 5.3.6 for all UI.
- Ensure all navigation and protected routes are guarded and role-based.
- All API integration must use the available endpoints as documented in the PRD.
- Do not implement features not supported by the backend API.
- Always do the changes step by step by breaking requirement into smaller.
- Implementing baas-bank UI step by step. remember only one small step at a time allowing me to review, commit and provide feedback.
- On each step, update prd for current changes
- Avoid custom CSS classes. Utilize Bootstrap's default classes and utilities as much as possible. If custom styling is absolutely necessary for a specific component that cannot be achieved with Bootstrap, ensure those styles are minimal and scoped to the component.
- no need to create empty scss files for components that do not require custom styles.
