# BaaS Bank - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: BaaS Bank - Banking as a Service Frontend  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Date**: June 3, 2025  
**Platform**: Web Application (Angular 17 + Bootstrap 5.3.6)  
**Backend Integration**: Banking as a Service API (Spring Boot Microservices)

## Executive Summary

BaaS Bank is a modern, responsive web application that provides a complete banking interface for customers and administrators. Built with Angular 17 and Bootstrap 5.3.6, it serves as the frontend counterpart to the Banking as a Service API microservices platform, offering secure banking operations through an intuitive user interface.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: Angular 17 (Standalone Components)
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5.3.6
- **State Management**: Angular Signals + Services
- **Authentication**: Angular JWT + Keycloak Integration
- **HTTP Client**: Angular HttpClient with Interceptors
- **Routing**: Angular Router with Guards
- **Forms**: Angular Reactive Forms
- **Icons**: Bootstrap Icons + Font Awesome
- **Build Tool**: Angular CLI with Webpack

### Backend Integration
- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:8080 (Banking as a Service)
- **Authentication**: Keycloak OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect
- **Communication**: RESTful APIs (Real-time notifications not available)
- **Security**: JWT Bearer Tokens

## General UI/UX Guidelines
- Use Angular 17 with standalone components and Bootstrap 5.3.6 for all UI.
- Ensure all navigation and protected routes are guarded and role-based.
- All API integration must use the available endpoints as documented in the PRD.
- Do not implement features not supported by the backend API.
- Always do the changes step by step by breaking requirement into smaller.
- Implementing baas-bank UI step by step. remember only one small step at a time allowing me to review, commit and provide feedback.
- On each step, update prd for current changes
- Avoid custom CSS classes. Utilize Bootstrap's default classes and utilities as much as possible. If custom styling is absolutely necessary for a specific component that cannot be achieved with Bootstrap, ensure those styles are minimal and scoped to the component.
- no need to create empty scss files for components that do not require custom styles.

### ✅ Completed Features
- None (Project initiation phase)

### 🔄 In Progress
- PRD document creation and review
- Project setup and initial configuration

### ❌ Pending Implementation
- All features (as per implementation phases)

### 📊 Overall Progress
**Current Status**: 0% - Project Planning Phase  
**Scope**: Focused on available API endpoints only  
**Next Milestone**: Phase 1 - Foundation & Authentication (Weeks 1-2)  
**Expected Completion**: 4 phases over 8 weeks  
**API Coverage**: 100% of available backend endpoints will be integrated

### 🚧 Scope Limitations
**Important Note**: This frontend application is limited by the current Banking as a Service API capabilities. Many advanced banking features (account statements, real-time notifications, advanced analytics, etc.) are not available in the backend and therefore cannot be implemented in the frontend until the corresponding API endpoints are developed.

**Future Development**: When additional API endpoints become available (Account Closure Saga, Transaction Dispute Saga, etc.), the frontend can be enhanced accordingly.

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Review Date**: June 3, 2025  
**Next Review Date**: June 10, 2025  
**Status**: Approved for Implementation

## Authentication & Registration Approach
- **All login and registration flows are handled exclusively via Keycloak.**
- The application will redirect users to the Keycloak login and registration pages for authentication and onboarding.
- No custom registration or login forms will be implemented in the Angular frontend.
- User creation, password management, and authentication are managed by Keycloak only.

## 2025-06-03: Welcome Page CSS Refactor
- All custom styles removed from WelcomeComponent; now relies entirely on Bootstrap classes and shared styles in styles.scss.
- Shared hover effect classes (.baas-card-hover, .baas-btn-hover) moved to styles.scss for global reuse.
- Welcome Page and all components now use only Bootstrap and shared/global custom classes, with no component-specific CSS.
- Fully compliant with copilot-instructions.md: avoid custom CSS classes unless absolutely necessary, and use Bootstrap utilities as much as possible.

## 2025-06-03: Authentication Flow & Keycloak Integration Update
- All Keycloak configuration values (base URL, client ID, token endpoint) are now centralized in `app.constants.ts` for maintainability and consistency.
- The Welcome Page uses these constants for login and register redirection, ensuring all authentication flows are handled via Keycloak as required.
- The Register button now redirects to the login page, since self-registration is disabled in Keycloak (registrationAllowed: false).
- The Angular app is configured to handle the Keycloak login redirect at `/auth/callback`, where the authorization code is exchanged for tokens and securely stored.
- All login and registration flows are fully compliant with the copilot-instructions.md: no custom forms, only Keycloak-managed authentication.
- No errors in WelcomeComponent; all authentication logic is now consistent and maintainable.

## 2025-06-03: Dashboard Component Implementation

## 2025-06-03: CSS Optimization
- Removed empty SCSS files from all components (Accounts, Payments, Transactions, Dashboard) to reduce unnecessary files.
- Updated component definitions to remove the `styleUrl` property, as no component-specific styling is needed.
- Strictly adhering to the Bootstrap-first approach outlined in copilot-instructions.md.
